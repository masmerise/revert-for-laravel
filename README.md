> [!WARNING]
> This package is supposed to be used *right after* having installed a **fresh** Laravel project using `laravel new`. 
> We are **not** responsible for any progress lost if you fail to follow this instruction.

## Why does this package exist?

This package aims to restore the former **5.0** structure with both the `Console` and `Http` kernels as this provides much more
flexibility compared to the new `ApplicationBuilder` class that comes with a lot of assumptions out of the box.

Laravel's new project structure simplified things a lot. However, this simplification comes at a trade-off.
Developers that are already well-versed in Laravel's ecosystem probably have no need for such a simplification because
the internals of the framework are like second nature to them.

As such, the main goal of this package is getting rid of `ApplicationBuilder` and keeping the other structural elements intact.

## Overview

These are the changes that'll be carried out in order to achieve the primary goal of this package,
which is the elimination of the new `ApplicationBuilder`:

1. `App\Console\Kernel` will be restored.
1. `App\Http\Kernel` will be restored.
1. `App\Exceptions\Handler` will be restored.
1. `App\Providers\RouteServiceProvider` will be restored.
1. The previous `boostrap/app.php` will be restored.
1. The `providers` key will be added back to `config/app.php`.
1. `bootstrap/providers.php` will be reconciled with the `providers` key in `config/app.php`.
1. `bootstrap/providers.php` will be removed.

> [!NOTE]
> If you need other previously available files such as `EventServiceProvider`,
> add these yourself. This package embraces the lean nature of the new structure except the `ApplicationBuilder`.
